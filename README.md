# MPMCP

This is the repo for MPMCP(multi-person multi-charge prediction) Dataset, which contains datasets contains four practical legal judgment scenarios:
- (S1) single defendant with a single charge,
- (S2) single defendant with multiple charges,
- (S3) multiple defendants with a single charge, and
- (S4) multiple defendants with multiple charges.

We evaluate the dataset across two LJP(legal judgment prediction) tasks: Charge Prediction and Penalty Term Prediction, and also conducted extensive experiments on both baselines like (BERT, T5, etc.) and a LLM.
